In a pan or wok, heat sufficient oil on medium flame. Then dip the marinated prawns in the batter by holding the tail and deep-fry on medium heat. Turn them frequently for two to three minutes until they are golden brown

Transfer them on a plate lined with absorbant paper and serve hot with a sauce of your choice.
